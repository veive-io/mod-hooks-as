## **Mod hooks**

### **Overview**

`mod-hooks-as` is a core library in the Veive protocol, providing the framework for creating hook modules that execute pre-checks and post-checks around operations within Koinos blockchain smart accounts. These modules enable additional logic to be run before and after main operations, offering enhanced flexibility and security.

### **Usage and Integration**

The `mod-hooks-as` library integrates seamlessly with the Veive protocol, enabling smart accounts to execute pre-checks and post-checks as part of the operation lifecycle.

This flexibility allows for a wide range of use cases and customizations, depending on the needs of the smart account and its operations.
